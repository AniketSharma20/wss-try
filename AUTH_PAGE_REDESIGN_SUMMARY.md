# Auth Page Redesign and Landing Page Refinement Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to the landing page and authentication pages to improve user experience and visual coherence.

## 1. Landing Page Introductory Text Refinement

The introductory text on the main landing page (`templates/landing-fixed.html`) has been updated to be more impactful and benefit-oriented.

**Before:**
- **Headline:** Your Safety is Our Top Priority
- **Sub-headline:** Advanced AI-powered security system designed specifically for women's safety. Get instant emergency assistance, live location tracking, and 24/7 protection with cutting-edge technology that puts your safety first.

**After:**
- **Headline:** Empowering Your Safety, Every Step of the Way
- **Sub-headline:** Experience unparalleled peace of mind with SafeGuard, the AI-powered security companion designed for women. Instant alerts, live tracking, and 24/7 protection—your safety, always on.

## 2. Sign-In and Sign-Up Page Redesign

The sign-in and sign-up pages have been redesigned with a new professional color palette and improved visual hierarchy. The changes were applied to the `static/auth-enhanced.css` stylesheet.

### Key Changes:

-   **New Color Palette:** The previous blue-themed color palette has been replaced with a more modern and professional one, featuring a softer blue/purple primary color (`#667eea`), a deep purple secondary color (`#764ba2`), and updated neutral and semantic colors (success, error, warning).
-   **Updated Visuals:** The shadows and border-radius values have been adjusted to create a softer, more modern aesthetic.
-   **Consistency:** The new color palette is consistent with the existing `static/landing-unified.css` stylesheet, ensuring a cohesive user experience between the landing page and the authentication flow.

These changes result in a more professional, visually appealing, and user-friendly authentication experience.
